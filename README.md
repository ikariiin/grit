## Your very own private library
This is a reading app that you can use on-device, meaning, this does not send your data off-device, providing absolute privacy.

This is achevied by parsing and rendering the EPUB contents in-browser.

This is also provided as a PWA, which in turn allows us to install this website as an app and offline accessibility.
